## Pushing Docker containers

Though you are unable to run `docker` commands in your pipelines as this
would require being able to be [outside](/docs/faq/can-i-run-docker-commands.html) the container, we have created
several *internal* steps in order to interact with docker.

Internal [steps](/docs/steps/index.html) are steps that are baked into the
wercker [cli](/docs/using-the-cli/available-commands.html) as these interact with
the Docker API that is external from the container. From a security perspective
we don't want to make this funcionality
available from inside the Docker container, and as such have created these *internal* steps.

In order to push to Docker registries you use the `internal/docker-push` step.
The following examples show how to push to Docker registries such as the
[Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/) and [Quay.io](http://quay.io) that adhere to
the `docker` API.

> When pushing to both public and private registries make sure you've
created the repository first

You can push to the following registries:

* [Docker Hub](#hub)
* [Quay.io](#quay)
* [Google Container Registry](#gcr)


<a name="hub"></a>
### Pushing to the public Docker Hub

```yaml
deploy:
  steps:
    - internal/docker-push:
        username: $USERNAME
        password: $PASSWORD
        tag: my-amazing-tag
        repository: turing/bar
        registry: https://registry.hub.docker.com
```

The `$USERNAME` and `$PASSWORD` fields are environment variables that
you should specify through the [wercker web interface](/docs/environment-variables/index.html). The `repo`
field contains the repository that you want to push to (in this case the
username `turing` with the `bar` image), and `registry` is
the URL of your Docker registry.

If your container needs a `cmd` to be run on startup of the container along
with a `port` that your application listens on, you can "bake" that into
the container as well:

```yaml
deploy:
  steps:
    - internal/docker-push:
        username: $USERNAME
        password: $PASSWORD
        tag: my-amazing-tag
        cmd: my-amazing-command
        ports: "5000"
        repository: turing/bar
        registry: https://registry.hub.docker.com
```

Same goes for an `entrypoint` directive:

```yaml
deploy:
  steps:
    - internal/docker-push:
        username: $USERNAME
        password: $PASSWORD
        tag: my-amazing-tag
        entrypoint: my-entrypoint
        repository: turing/bar
        registry: https://registry.hub.docker.com
```

> If you're pushing to the Docker Hub, the registry field is optional and can be omitted.

<a name="quay"></a>
### Pushing to quay.io

If you want to push to a different (private) registry such as [quay.io](http://quay.io) you
would create the following [wercker.yml](/docs/wercker-yml/creating-a-yml.html) file:

```yaml
deploy:
  steps:
    - internal/docker-push:
        username: $USERNAME
        password: $PASSWORD
        tag: my-amazing-tag
        repository: quay.io/knuth/foo
        registry: https://quay.io
```

Again `$USERNAME` and `$PASSWORD` are pipeline environment variables.
For the repository field, you prefix it with the domain name of your registry
when not using the Docker Hub. Here we push to the repo with username
`knuth` and the image `foo`.

<a name="gcr"></a>
### Pushing to the Google Container Registry (gcr.io)

When pushing to the Google Container Registry (also known as
[gcr.io](http://gcr.io)) you need authenticate by using a token. As such
an extra step is involved in retrieving the token and subsequently using
it in the `internal/docker-push` step:

```yaml
deploy:
  box: google/cloud-sdk
  steps:
    - script:
        name: install jq
        code: wget -O /usr/local/bin/jq https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.5rc1/jq-linux-x86_64-static && chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/jq
    - script:
        name: gcr.io authentication
        code: |
          export CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS=true
          gcloud auth activate-refresh-token $GCLOUD_ACCOUNT $GCLOUD_REFRESH_TOKEN
          gcloud config set project $GCLOUD_PROJECT
          gcloud config set compute/zone $GCLOUD_ZONE
          gcloud preview docker --authorize_only
          export GCR_AUTH_TOKEN=$(cat $HOME/.dockercfg | jq --raw-output '.["https://gcr.io"].auth' | base64 --decode | cut -d ':' -f2)
    - internal/docker-push:
        username: _token
        password: $GCR_AUTH_TOKEN
        repository: gcr.io/<MY-PROJECT>/<MY-IMAGE>
        registry: https://gcr.io
```

Thanks to wercker user [vially](https://github.com/vially) for providing these steps!


> Note the `internal/docker-push` step only works with registries that
comply with the Docker Registry API.
