### Setting up the app

Before we can start developing, we have to fork and clone the [starting
app](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-python) into our local
development environment. After you've done that, `cd` into the project
directory.

```
$ cd python-getting-started/
```

Next, ensure that everything is working by running the app

```
$ python app.py
```

Now in your browser navigate to `127.0.0.1:5000/cities.json` and you should be
presented with the following output:

```
[
"Amsterdam",
"San Francisco",
"Berlin",
"New York"
]
```

Once you've verified everything's working, head on to the [next
step](http://devcenter.wercker.com/docs/getting-started/developing.html)!
