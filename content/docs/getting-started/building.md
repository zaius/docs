### Building your app
Now that we're done developing, we want to build and test our app in an
automated fashion. Luckily, wercker does just that. 

Let's review our `werkcer.yml` file. 


```yaml
box: python:2.7-slim
dev:
  steps:
    - pip-install
    - internal-watch:
        code: python app.py
        reload: true
```

Currently we haven't told wercker anything about how we want our build
_pipeline_ to look like. Let's change that by adding the `build` section:

```yaml
box: python:2.7-slim
dev:
  steps:
    - pip-install
    - internal-watch:
        code: python app.py
        reload: true
build:
  steps:
    - pip-install
    - script:
        name: python unit test
        code: |
          python app_test.py
```

### Build Pipeline
Let's take a closer look at our **wercker.yml** file again. 

`- pip-install`

This is the same step that we used in our `dev section`. It installs all our
requirements specified in the requirements.txt.

```
- script:
    name: python unit test
    code: |
      python app_test.py
```

This is a simple inline **bash** script. You can create these steps directly in
your **wercker.yml** or share them with the community by [submitting a step to
our repository](http://devcenter.wercker.com/docs/steps/creating-steps.html).
This script simply runs the unit tests using python. 

### Wercker build
Now that we have a better understanding of our **wercker.yml** let's go ahead
and let wercker **build** our project. In your project folder, run

```
$ wercker build

```

It seems like our test is failing because we added a new city that isn't
reflected in the tests.  Go ahead ahead and add our new city to `app_test.py`
and run the `wercker build` again.

```
self.assertEqual(response.data, json.dumps(['Amsterdam', 'San Francisco', 'Berlin', 'New York', 'Tokyo']))
```

It should give you the following output:

```
pip install succeeded
--> Running step: python unit test
.

OK
--> Steps passed
--> Pipeline finished
```

Success! 

Building locally is very useful when you're not sure your code  will run
because of some changes you made and as such you don't want to push these
changes to your Git provider just yet.

But since we've verified that our app is compiling and running correctly, it's
time to let wercker build & deploy your app in the cloud, which is what we'll
be doing in the [next
step](http://devcenter.wercker.com/docs/getting-started/add_app_cloud.html).
