## Environment variables

What if you have an API key you need during a deploy or during a build? This is
information that is either unique for each server you want to deploy to or may be
too sensitive to store in the repository. Wercker supports a number of ways to
store and expose this data as environment variables.

### Global environment variables

There are variables which are `global`. These are available during builds and deploys.
Typically, these are used to store API tokens for after-steps such as hipchat, campfire etc.
These variables are called pipeline variables and can be set in the settings tab
of your application.

### Deploy environment variables

The second set of variables are specific to `deploy targets`, and can only be set
directly on the deploy target. Typically, these are used to store information
such as `hostnames`, `ssh-keys`, `passwords` and more.
These variables are called `deploy target variables`.

### Available environment variables

You can also use a [script step](/learn/steps/introduction.html) and use the export
command to see the full list of all variables at that moment during the build/deploy.
This is convenient since there are reasons why the environment variables step does
not show all environment variables available during the pipeline run.

If you want to know which environment variables are available during a build or
deploy, look at the environment variables step of your pipeline run.

```yaml
- script:
    code: |
        export
```
